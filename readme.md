# Doom3 Starter Kit

## About
This is a starter kit for making standalone projects with the [Doom 3 engine.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Tech_4)

This kit includes:

- the minimal amount of art/data assets required to run the game.
- one test map.

Use this as a starting point for your projects, make cool stuff, enjoy!

## Usage

This package does not include the game executable. Because the Doom 3 engine is open-source, you have different options for getting the executable.

- I recommend the [dhewm3](https://dhewm3.org) source port. If you don't want to compile the executable yourself, you can [click here](https://github.com/dhewm/dhewm3/releases) to download dhewm3's pre-compiled binaries.
- You can also try out the [original release of the Doom 3 source code.](https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM-3)

How to use this kit:

1. In the folder that has the game executable, place the 'base' folder.
2. Run the game executable.

## Why Doom 3?

I like the Doom 3 engine for a lot of reasons, including:

- It's [open-source](https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM-3)
- Its codebase is [nice and tidy](https://fabiensanglard.net/doom3)
- I've been using the [idTech game engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Tech) for a while, including projects [Quadrilateral Cowboy](http://blendogames.com/qc) (idTech4), [Thirty Flights of Loving](http://blendogames.com/thirtyflightsofloving) (idTech2), [Gravity Bone](https://blendogames.com/gravitybone) (idTech2), [Grotto King](https://blendogames.com/older.htm#grottoking) (idTech2), [Barista](https://blendogames.com/older.htm#barista1) (idTech1), and more.

## Is this compatible with Doom 3 BFG Edition?

No.
